3D Plane Projection
This Java program takes a set of 3D points representing a polygon on a plane and projects them onto a 3D plane at an inclined angle. It considers extreme points based on the azimuth angle, calculates distances from non-extreme points to the line formed by extreme points, and then adjusts the height (z-coordinate) of each point accordingly.
